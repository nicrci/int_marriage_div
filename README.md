## Results

The marriage ratio graph reveals that the top six countries for marriages with Taiwanese nationals are China (1.17%), Vietnam (1.42%), Hong Kong and Macao (0.51%), the United States (0.35%), Japan (0.29%), and Malaysia (0.25%). On the other hands, divorce ratio graph shows the top 6 countries that have the most divorce rate which are China (3.25%), Vietnam (2.26%), Indonesia (0.29%), Hong Kong and Macao (0.24%), Japan (0.2%), and Thailand (0.2%). 

A significant insight that this project has provided has a lot to do with gender imbalances and socio-economic challenges, which has been found to be largely due to hypergamy and hypogamy (Su et al, 2024). In the light of hypergamy, Japanese and U.S. marriages involve more men than women who are married to Taiwanese women. We can also see the influence of hypogamy among Vietnamese and Chinese female nationals who are married with Taiwanese males.

This project has also provided insights in regards to border policy differences. International marriages, driven by historical and economic ties, increased post-pandemic as travel resumed, but divorce rates also rose due to lockdown stress. This has been noted to be suppressed marriages and divorces (Su et al, 2024)

This project has provided insights regarding the marriage and divorce landscape in Taiwan, including its potential influencers such as urbanization, international migration, cultural beliefs, and socio-economic factors.
